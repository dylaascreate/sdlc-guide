## What is this project?

This project is a single‑page site built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript that explains and compares multiple software development methodologies such as Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Spiral, RAD, DevOps, Lean, XP, Prototyping variants, RUP, DSDM, and more.
It presents each methodology with a short description, key characteristics, pros and cons, and when it is typically suitable to use.

## Main features

- Learn section with visually rich cards for each methodology, including overview, structure, flexibility, recommended team size, and typical usage scenarios. 
- Detail modal for any methodology, showing process flow steps, advantages, disadvantages, and “when to use” guidance. 
- Compare section that lets you select two methodologies and see their attributes side‑by‑side plus a small decision-aid table. 
- Quiz section with 12 questions that scores your answers against all methodologies and recommends the top three SDLC approaches for your project.

## Who is it for?

SDLC Guide is aimed at students, junior developers, product owners, and anyone who needs a quick, visual way to understand different SDLCs and when each one is appropriate.
It can be used as a learning aid, a teaching demo in class, or a lightweight decision helper during project planning.
